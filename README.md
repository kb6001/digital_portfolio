S – Situation:
During the work readiness programme, I participated in a career counselling session aimed at helping students identify career goals aligned with their personal values and academic strengths.

T – Task:
My task was to complete a career interest assessment and use the feedback to reflect on possible ICT career paths.

I completed the assessment and discussed the results in a guided session. I then researched roles that matched my top interests and documented my findings in my portfolio.

I gained a clearer understanding of my career goals and created a shortlist of potential job roles, such as software developer and IT support analyst, that align with both my skills and interests.

I developed a visual and written profile showing a match between my strong interests in coding and teamwork, helping to support my choice to pursue software development.

As part of the preparation, I completed a personality assessment to better understand how I function in academic and work environments.
